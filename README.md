# Data_Analysis_Pipeline

This is an exercise to practice the real-world data science operational flow.

# Files description
`Dockerfile` Specifying the base image as Ubuntu and installs Python3 with the required packages. It then creates a directory inside the container at /home/doc-bd-a1/ and copies the dataset into it and opens the bash shell upon startup.

`load.py` Dynamically reads the dataset file by accepting the file path as a user-provided argument.

`dpre.py` Performs example Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Reduction, and Data Discretization steps then saves the resulting data frame as a new CSV file named res_dpre.csv. 

`eda.py` Conducts exploratory data analysis, generating at least 3 insights without visualizations then saves these insights as text files named eda-in-1.txt, and so on.

`vis.py` Creates a single visualization and save it as vis.png.

`model.py` Implements the K-means algorithm on the data frame then saves the number of records in each cluster as a text file named k.txt.

`final.sh` Is a simple bash script to copy the output files generated by dpre.py, eda.py, vis.py, and model.py from the container to the local machine in bd-a1/service-result/ then closes the container.

**Note:** Each one of these files automatically invokes the next one.

# Usage guide
After cloning the repository, open the command terminal and navigate to it then build the image:

`docker build -t bd-a1 .`

Then run the container with:

`docker run -it --name bd-a1 bd-a1`

Copy all the python files into the container:

`
docker cp load.py bd-a1:home/doc-bd-a1

docker cp dpre.py bd-a1:home/doc-bd-a1

docker cp eda.py bd-a1:home/doc-bd-a1

docker cp vis.py bd-a1:home/doc-bd-a1

docker cp model_.py bd-a1:home/doc-bd-a1
`

Now, you can start the pipeline:

`python3 load.py <dataset_path>`

Finally, open git bash and navigate to the repository and run:

`bash final.sh`

The analysis results will appear on your local machine inside `/service-results/` and the container will close itself
